Recently I started to blog again, and created a new blog. As a result I wanted to create a companion RSS reader. I used TT-RSS and the following directions about hosting it on Heroku. It does work! 

# TT-RSS on Heroku

> It is possible and it works, even with free dynos!

Thanks [Tiny Tiny RSS](http://tt-rss.org) for your existence, and thanks to [Reuben Castelino](https://projectdelphai.github.io/blog/2013/03/15/replacing-google-reader-with-tt-rss-on-heroku/) and [Art Chaidarun](https://chaidarun.com/ttrss-heroku) for pioneering the deploy on Heroku.

If you have issues, feel free to bug report/submit pull request. Depending on spare time I'll look into it.


## Quick start

> (note: the Deploy to Heroku button [doesn't support](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-button#requirements) projects with submodules, so this repo can't be auto-deployed. However, the instructions are pretty simple!)

Supposing you have already a Heroku account and you have the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) installed:

```sh
# clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/serl/ttrss-heroku.git && cd ttrss-heroku

# create the application (names are unique on the platform)
$ heroku create my-fancy-ttrss

# we'll need a database
$ heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev

# consider adding plugins now, you'll spare some extra builds (see Â§Adding plugins)

# everything is ready, push! (this will take time)
$ git push heroku master

# and enjoy (default credentials are admin:password; you should change the password immediately)
$ heroku open
```


## Update the feeds

As you'll quickly discover, the feeds are *not* going to update by themselves.

### Solution #1 *(recommended)*

Use the scheduler addon:

```sh
$ heroku addons:create scheduler:standard
$ heroku addons:open scheduler
```

Then on the web interface that appears, add a new hourly job. The command to run is `update`.

NOTE: in order to comply the 10k row limit of the free tier, after the update I'm truncating the `ttrss_tags` table, as I'm not personally using this feature (and it uses a lot of rows).

### Solution #2

You could fire worker dyno with the `update-daemon` command (but think about those juicy dyno hours).


## Feed icons are disappearing!

There's a solution!
Create an account on Amazon Web Services, a bucket on S3 (names are unique on the platform) and credentials to access to it from IAM.
When you have all this, set these variables on the application (change where needed):

```sh
$ heroku config:set \
  AWS_REGION=eu-central-1 \
  AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=my-fancy-ttrss \
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=youraccesskeyid \
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=yoursecretaccesskey
```

Then, if you want the icons to appear, you should force the application to reload them (**don't do this if you're updating with *Solution #2*!**):

```sh
$ heroku run update-icons
$ heroku restart
```


## Adding plugins

You can add custom plugins by setting the env variable `TTRSS_PLUGINS`.
It should be a comma-separated list of items in the format `name:git-repository-url#branch_or_tag` (or `name:git-repository-url`, if the default branch is ok for you).

For example:

```sh
$ heroku config:set \
  TTRSS_PLUGINS='favicon_badge:https://github.com/ctag/favicon_badge,fever:https://github.com/DigitalDJ/tinytinyrss-fever-plugin#master'
$ git push -f heroku HEAD~:master && git push heroku master # dirty trick to trigger a rebuild (not needed if you're installing or updating)
```


## Update TT-RSS version

Either you update the submodule in `tt-rss`, or you wait me to pick the latest commit (and then pull my changes), then update your Heroku application (`git push heroku master`).


## Tips to spare dyno hours

* Prefer scheduler over daemon for updates (*Solution #1*)... Maybe less than once per hour?
* Put wisely the update interval for each feed (I mean *as loose as possible*).
* Let the web dyno go to sleep when it's tired (don't keep that tab always open / use The Great Suspender on Chrome).
* *(unrelated to dyno hours, but still important)* As we're in the free tier for the database, we're limited to 10k rows. Check from time to time if you're compliant (Heroku web interface is friendly). If not, consider deleting some feeds.


## TODOs

* Persist sessions (memcached)?
* Email digest support
* *You name it*
